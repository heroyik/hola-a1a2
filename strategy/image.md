# Image Generation & Design Strategy

## 🎨 Overview

This document outlines the visual language and image generation guidelines for the **Hola-AL** Spanish textbook project. Our goal is to create a premium, modern, and engaging learning experience.

## ✨ Visual Language: "Modern & Premium Spanish"

- **Style**: Modern Anime Style using Vertex AI Imagen 3.
  - **Background Concept**: "Travel & Emotion" — focuses on the excitement of travel through high-quality scenery.
  - **Aesthetic Consistency (Reference: bookcover2a*.png)**:
    - **Lighting**: Strong, warm natural sunlight (Golden Hour) coming through windows, creating distinct shadows and an inviting atmosphere.
    - **Line Art**: Clean, slightly textured line art consistent with modern "Seinen" anime aesthetics.
    - **Background Details**: High-fidelity indoor settings (Spanish-style tiling, wooden furniture, potted plants) combined with "Travel & Emotion" landscapes.
    - **Character Design**: Natural and modern outfits (khakis, sweaters, denim), friendly expressions, and consistent facial proportions.
    - **Color Grading**: Warm, saturated tones with a focus on terracotta, wood grains, and Mediterranean light.
  - **Reference Styles**:
    - **Makoto Shinkai** (*Your Name*, *Weathering with You*): Beautiful light utilization and atmospheric reimagining of real locations.
    - **Violet Evergarden**: Extremely detailed European background art with an emotional atmosphere.
  - **Key Examples**: sunset views of Alhambra, Sagrada Familia details, Las Fallas fireworks, Sevilla Feria wide shots.
  - **Features**: Detailed background rendering, interplay of light and shadow, painterly textures (watercolor/oil), and atmosphere designed to trigger "Wanderlust".

- **Color Palette**:
  - Spain Red (#A93226)
  - Gold (#D4AC0D)
  - Soft Charcoal (#2C3E50) for readability
  - Off White (#FCF9F2) for backgrounds
- **Layout**: Sleek Modernism with high-end table designs and generous white space.

## ⚙️ Generation Guidelines (Imagen 3)

1. **Tool**: Only use Vertex AI Imagen 3 API.
2. **Character Age**: College students/young adults (20s).
3. **Accuracy**: 100% match between vocabulary words and visual labels in the illustration.
4. **Localization**: Ensure no Japanese or Chinese characters appear in the generated art.
5. **Storage**: Save images in `/images/` and use relative paths (e.g., `../images/image_name.png`).

## 🖼️ Section-Specific Rules

### 2. Vocabulario Esencial

- Every word listed in the vocabulary table must be reflected in the illustration.
- Word labels must be clearly mapped within the image.

### 5. Cultura Viva
