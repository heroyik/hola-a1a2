Reviewing the 4 generated images for Chapter 2:

1. A1 Vocab (ch02_a1_vocab_personality_v20):
- Needs 10 labels: 1(cheerful), 2(sad), 3(serious), 4(unpleasant), 5(friendly), 6(tall), 7(short), 8(thin), 9(chubby), 10(intelligent).
- Observation: Image shows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10. Wait, there are duplicate 2s, 3s, and 8s. Also missing 7. The labels have text (e.g. "6 alto"). Prompt said "No text". This is a failure.

2. A1 Cultura (ch02_a1_culture_greeting_v20):
- Needs to show 'Dos besos' greeting between a man and a woman in a sunny plaza.
- Observation: Shows a man and a woman leaning in for a kiss on the cheek in a Spanish street setting. No text. Looks accurate. Passed.

3. A2 Vocab (ch02_a2_vocab_emotions_v20_retry):
- Needs 12 labels: 1(confused), 2(proud), 3(embarrassed), 4(bored), 5(worried), 6(surprised), 7(angry), 8(jealous), 9(hopeful), 10(exhausted), 11(scared), 12(tranquil).
- Observation: Labels 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (two 6s), 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 (two 11s), 12. There are duplicates. Failure. 12 items is too many.

4. A2 Cultura (ch02_a2_culture_social_v20_retry):
- Gen Z taking photo of food (postureo), another person stressed by phone.
- Observation: Shows a girl taking a photo of food, a boy looking stressed at his phone. Fits perfectly. Passed.

Conclusion:
A1 Vocab: Failed (duplicates, missing, text included). Need to split 10 items into two batches of 5, or refine prompt significantly.
A2 Vocab: Failed (duplicates). Need to split 12 items into two batches of 6, as we did for Chapter 1.
