**Prompt:** A4 book cover titled "NUEVA ERA: ESPAÑOL CON IA". The design is a futuristic Japanese anime illustration blended with cutting-edge Spanish graphic design. A young Korean learner in a smart hub interacts with a holographic AI interface, from which glowing data streams in Google colors (blue, red, yellow, green) burst forth. These streams form a dynamic cloud of Spanish words, phrases, and cultural icons (Don Quixote silhouette, Sagrada Familia, flamenco dancer) that are being organized and downloaded into the learner's mind. The background is a fusion of futuristic architecture resembling the Guggenheim Bilbao and geometric Spanish tile patterns. The subtitle "DELE A1-A2" is below the title. The text "Basado en el plan curricular A1/A2 de Instituto Cervantes y ¡Hola, español! 1,2. Potenciado por el ecosistema de Google AI." is integrated into the central glowing data. "VOZVIVA LINGUISTICA" is at the bottom.
