**Prompt:** A4 book cover, Japanese anime illustration style blended with modern Spanish graphic design. A stylish young Korean woman with glowing headphones is dynamically leaping across a bridge made of illuminated data streams and Google icon colors (blue, red, yellow, green) connecting a futuristic Seoul skyline on the left to distorted, artistic representations of Barcelona landmarks like Sagrada Familia and Park Güell on the right. The background features bold, geometric patterns and vibrant colors inspired by contemporary Spanish street art. The title at the top is large, bold typography: "SALTO AL ESPAÑOL". Below it, smaller text reads: "DELE A1-A2". In a dark band at the bottom, the text reads: "Basado en el plan curricular A1/A2 de Instituto Cervantes y ¡Hola, español! 1,2. Potenciado por el ecosistema de Google AI." At the very bottom center, the publisher name: "VOZVIVA LINGUISTICA".
